	Network status can be:

	0 unknown

	1 available

	2 current

	3 forbidden
	
	You cannot issue this query while the card is searching for an available network (CREG: 0,2 is reported in response to AT+CREG).

	4.2.2 Selecting a network

	The GT will register on the first available network that the SIM allows. This is usually the network of the SIM provider (if you are at home), or a network that has roaming contract with the SIM-supplier network (if you are abroad). If you are roaming and you want to register to a network manually then type:

	AT+COPS=1,2,""
	
	1 means "manual registration", 2 means you want to specify the network in

	network ID format, finally the ID in quotes.

	After several seconds you get
	
	OK or ERROR

	Errors can occur because for example you tried to register to a forbidden network. You cannot force registration on to a network that does not have a roaming agreement with the SIM provider. You cannot roam on to another network in your own country since they are the same country code (e.g. you have D1 SIM card in Germany and you want to use D2. Since they are competitors, it won't work).

	If manual registration is forced, the GlobeTrotter stays in this mode and will not scan again until

	AT+COPS=0 is issued.
